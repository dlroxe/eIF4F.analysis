<p>Please note the descriptions of Systems 1, 2, and 3 from <a href="https://github.com/a3609640/eIF4F.analysis#readme" class="external-link">README.md</a>. Behavior of the package on Windows was evaluated using these systems, at different points during package development by David Roxe, as a favor to the authors. The following account includes some investigation regarding apparent differences in current behavior on Windows, compared to past behavior.</p>
<p>On Nov 2. 2020, I submitted a descriptive change <a href="https://github.com/a3609640/EIF-analysis/commit/26a1b84082450ca219319ec134c83c8b53437b67" class="external-link">here</a> to indicate that the package was observed to work on System 2. In particular, note that the then-current version of R was v4.0.3.</p>
<p>I learned of a report that the current version of this package could not complete its execution (specifically its correlation analysis) within expected time frames on Windows 10, even with powerful hardware. The “expected time frames” were the times consistently observed on Linux using System 1. My observations on Windows 11 on System 3 matched the report on Windows 10. I was able to see every step complete fairly quickly, except for correlation analysis.</p>
<p>I used the “profiling” feature of RStudio to analyze the “lung” portion of the correlation analysis (because this is much more tractable than the “all” portion). I found that two places accounted for nearly all CPU time: ComplexHeatmap:Heatmap(), and .correlation_coefficient(), in COR.R.</p>
<p>Since correlation analysis was consistently observed to execute in timely fashion on Linux, I attempted a controlled comparison.</p>
<p>First, to rule out any difficulty with RStudio on Windows, I evaluated direct use of R-4.2.1 on Windows. Although it was marginally faster for most tasks performed by the package, correlation analysis still did not complete in a reasonable time. I concluded that RStudio was not the cause of the performance difficulty.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of modern Windows is the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” (WSL). This feature permits the installation of various Linux distributions within specialized environments managed by Windows. Notably, Linux binaries do not need to be recompiled in order to execute within WSL. Windows is able to execute them in the same way they execute natively on Linux. Thus, WSL provides an opportunity to rule out Windows as a culprit for the performance difficulty, by comparing the behavior of Windows-native R and Linux-native R, both executing under Windows.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that WSL is not perfect. Although it can decipher and execute the Linux binary format, it does not formally guarantee equivalence to an actual Linux runtime environment. Dynamically-linked Linux libraries may be absent (or at least expected versions may be absent). Thus, certain runtime errors may arise during execution of Linux binaries under WSL that may not arise during execution under Linux.</p>
<p>I installed the Ubuntu 22.04 WSL package, and configured it with several several Ubuntu packages necessary to support the various dependencies of this R package. I then (with some trouble) completed an installation of this R package in that WSL environment. Note, WSL forced the use of R-4.1.2 instead of R-4.2.1; this in turn forced use of BiocManager 3.1.4 instead of BiocManager-3.1.5. This in turn affected other package versions.</p>
<p>Under WSL, I was able to execute the package, but not reliably. I sometimes encountered runtime errors, particularly “recursive gc invocation”. I attribute this to complications with WSL library compatibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was able to observe, repeatedly, execution of the entire package (including correlation analysis) in approximately 20m. Note that I made <a href="https://github.com/a3609640/eIF4F.analysis/commit/c6e25e5dd9f2cb4856429fb4186cff357a6251f5" class="external-link">some adjustments to Analysis.R</a> in order to facilitate this. As an example of such an adjustment, it seems to me that the Windows-native R can only fetch biological pathway analysis data from a remote website using ‘curl’; whereas the Linux-native R can only do so using ‘wget’.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul><li>The package worked on Windows 10 on System 2 in Nov 2020 (with Windows-native R 4.0.3), but correlation analysis seems to require inordinate execution time (if it completes execution at all) on Windows 10 and Windows 11 in Oct 2022.</li>
<li>Because the performance problem has been seen recently on Windows 10 and 11, it does not seem as though the Windows version is the culprit.</li>
<li>Because the problem has been seen with and without RStudio, it does not seem as though RStudio is the culprit.</li>
<li>Profiling suggests that a great deal of CPU time is expended in .correlation_coefficient(). Although it’s true that the package code has substantially changed ince Nov 2020, it should be noted that the body of .correlation_coefficient() <a href="https://github.com/a3609640/EIF-analysis/blob/8ea7dada7e7d5ba732c6e10cb28215fdb6eb06e6/R/EIFanalysis.R#L5703" class="external-link">has not changed significantly</a>. So, code changes in the package seem unlikely to be the culprit.</li>
<li>It is possible that the package works on Windows with versions R v4.0.3 and v4.1.2, but cannot work properly with Windows-native R at v4.2.1. I did not evaluate behavior with a Windows-native R v4.1.2 binary.</li>
<li>R package versions may also vary between R v4.1.2 an R v.4.2.1. It may be that these R package version differences are more blameworthy than R binary version differences.</li>
<li>It is possible that a difference between executable binaries for Windows-native R and Linux-native R is the culprit for poor performance on Windows-native R.</li>
</ul><p>That is, I <em>do</em> suspect that a current peculiarity of Windows, R, and this package (and their manner of interaction) might explain the Windows performance difficulty. I <em>do not</em> suspect a code path within the R package itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility of executing this package on Windows using WSL, as a way to work-alike with Linux, that unfortunately does not seem to me like a promising approach at the present time.</p>
<ul><li>The installation procedure itself has many complexities beyond the existing procedure. WSL installation itself is not yet entirely trivial. After a Ubuntu-22.04 was installed, separate installs were necessary for several development packages. The version of R available with default package repositories was too old; so system package repositories required adjustment. R package installation required several retries, seemingly due to network interface difficulties. Unprivileged installation of R packages did not work “out of the box”.</li>
<li>As noted above, the WSL R installation is not stable; and despite attempts I am unable to provide details (much less a fix or workaround) for that at this time.</li>
<li>Even if the installation could be documented, and package execution could be made reliable, and execution time were therefore repeatably quick, resource consumption would still present a difficulty. Specifically WSL is subject to a RAM limitation: It has access to at most 50% of system RAM. Some web search results suggest “50% or 8GB, whichever is smaller”, but at any rate I note that on System 3, which has 128G of RAM, WSL reports that it has 64G of RAM available. Because 48G are recommended for exeuction of the package, under WSL the recommended hardware would include 96G of RAM (which would preclude the use of most PC laptops on the market today, because consumer PC laptops provide support for 64G or less.</li>
</ul><p>My own instinct is that the correlation analysis portion of the package may not be easily supportable on Windows at the present time. I hasten to point out that I have often have seen all package code other than correlation analysis complete quickly, with Windows-native R.</p>
